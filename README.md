# My Portoflio Website

This is a portfolio website made in the image of a BASH terminal. It includes some common shortcuts, commands, and more.  
It is painfully made from the scratch, completely manually emulated without the use of libraries which would do this for me or the use of AI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start`

Runs the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
